* DONE Handout (PDF)

  I'm thinking about making the handout the code + Bayes' Theorem.

* DONE Large text corpus

  Could easily be big.txt from Norvig.

* TODO Two evaluation sets

  I would love them to be bigger than Norvig's

  And how can I get some for autocorrecting touchscreen keyboards

* DONE Generate PDF of slides
